        <p>I am a doctoral candidate in the <a href='https://chem.cornell.edu' target='_blank'>chemistry and chemical biology</a> department at <a href='https://cornell.edu' target='_blank'>Cornell University</a> where I work under the advisement of <a href='https://collum.chem.cornell.edu' target='_blank'>Professor David B. Collum</a> on the structural and mechanistic study of organoalkali chemistry, a cornerstone of organic synthesis for the better part of the past century. Prior to matriculation, I graduated from <a href='https://nyu.edu' target='_blank'>New York University's</a> <a href='https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/' target='_blank'>global campus in Abu Dhabi</a> in the United Arab Emirates with a bachelors of science in chemistry (further specialization in biochemistry) and a minor in urban development. During my time there I worked under the mentorship of Professors <a href='https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/pance-naumov.html' target='_blank'>Panƒçe Naumov</a> and <a href='https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/wael-m-rabeh.html' target='_blank'>Wael Rabeh</a> to explore the structure and function relationships of bioluminescence. Previously, I received an International Baccalaureate diploma from the <a href='https://www.uwc-usa.org/' target='_blank'>Armand Hammer United World College of the American West</a> in Montezuma, New Mexico supported by the Davis Scholarship. I was born in Overland Park, Kansas and grew up in Omaha, Nebraska.
