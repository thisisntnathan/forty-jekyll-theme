        <!-- <h2 id="content">Nathan Lui</h2> -->
        <p>I am currently a postdoctoral scientist at <a href='https://www.lilly.com/' target='_blank'>Eli Lilly and Company</a> focusing primarily on developing template-free methods for reaction product prediction using large-scale machine learning on graph-to-graph translations. I sit on the global computational chemistry & chemiformatics team in the Discovery Chemistry Research and Technology department of Lilly Research Laboratories where I also provide computational support to small-molecule drug discovery projects in the hit-to-lead and lead-optimization stages. Aside from the science, I am chair of the Lilly Postdoc Community and lead the global Postdoc Summit planning committee.</p>
        <p>I received my doctor of philosophy in organic chemistry in 2023 from the department of <a href='https://chem.cornell.edu' target='_blank'>chemistry and chemical biology</a> at <a href='https://cornell.edu' target='_blank'>Cornell University</a> in Ithaca, New York where I worked under the advisement of <a href='https://chemistry.cornell.edu/david-b-collum' target='_blank'>Professor David B. Collum</a> on the structural and mechanistic study of organoalkali chemistry, a cornerstone of asymmetric synthesis for the better part of the past century. In the spring of 2023, I interned at <a href='https://www.exscientia.ai/' target='_blank'>Exscientia</a> exploring methods of improving early-stage compound scoring, ranking, and selection using machine learning. Prior to Cornell, I graduated from <a href='https://nyu.edu' target='_blank'>New York University's</a> <a href='https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/' target='_blank'>global campus in Abu Dhabi</a> in the United Arab Emirates with a bachelors of science in chemistry (with further specialization in biochemistry) and a minor in urban development and economics. During my time there I worked under the mentorship of Professors <a href='https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/pance-naumov.html' target='_blank'>Panƒçe Naumov</a> and <a href='https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/faculty/wael-m-rabeh.html' target='_blank'>Wael Rabeh</a> to explore the structure and function relationships of bioluminescence. Previously, I received an International Baccalaureate diploma from the <a href='https://www.uwc-usa.org/' target='_blank'>Armand Hammer United World College of the American West</a> in Montezuma, New Mexico supported by the Davis Scholarship. I was born in Overland Park, Kansas and grew up in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
        <p>Away from the bench, I am an avid cyclist and snowboarder, an ameteur art enthusiast, and an ardent foodie.

                <p>My graduate research focused on the mechanistic determination of alkylations of Oppolzer's camphorsultam-derived enolates. On the side, I provided compuational chemistry support to a wide range of projects throughout the department and dabbled in developing generative molecular graph models with a project team. At NYU Abu Dhabi my research focused on physical studies of bio- and chemi-luminescence, with experience in the spectroscopy, structural biochemistry, and computational aspects of the systems. <a href='/research.html#past'>Read more</a>
