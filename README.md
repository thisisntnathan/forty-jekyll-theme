# My changes to Forty

- Updated icon support to font-awesome v5.15 from the included v4.6 (`_sass/scss/`, `assets/webfonts/`, `assets/css/main.scss` )  
- Minimized footer (`footer.html`)  
  - Removed phone number  
  - Removed contact from  
  - Placed address and icons in same row  
- Swapped list <ul> with alternative list style <ul alt> (done rather sloppily, watch out for spacing issues...) (`_sass/components/_list.scss`)  
- Removed date from posts (better formatting available inside post content) (`allposts.html`)  
- Add $\LaTeX$ support by MathJax (`head.html`)
- If there are an odd number of tiles on the home page the theme now stretches the last one to fill the row (`_sass/components/_tiles.scss`)
- Removed extra slash (`/`) in homepage (`header.html`)
