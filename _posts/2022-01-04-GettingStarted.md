So I first had the idea to make my own website when I was applying for some fellowship (that I didn't end up getting) and they limited my CV to 1 page. I thought "What about all of the stuff I wanted to explain!?" Where do I talk about all of that? It wouldn't be for another two years that I would actually sit down and take the time to make this website, but now it's finally starting to take shape, like a mound of clay into bowl *or something like that, I don't know, I'm not good at art*. Bear with me as I get around to sanding down the edges and rounding off the corners.
