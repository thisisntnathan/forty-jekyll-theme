                A <em>general</em> method for the asymmetric alkylation of ketones remains, to this day, a mountain unconquered<!--, despite it's vast potential in organic synthesis -->. While photo- and electro-catalytic methods may be the <em>flavor du jour</em>, the asymmetric alkylation of carbonyls was born from the chemistry of enolates and azaenolates through the use of chiral auxiliaries, a method that remains, to this day, <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/anie.201703079' target='_blank'>the most effective route to optically pure α-substituted ketones</a>. We are currently studying the structural and mechanistic underpinnings of the alkylations of <em>N</em>-acyl Oppolzer sultam enolates.

                <b>A new series of hydrocarbon-soluble organosodium bases with wide-ranging synthetic applications.</b>
                Sodium hexamethyldisilazide is the synthetic world's preeminent organosodium reagent owing to its solubility, stability, and wide commercial availability; all reasons for which it has surpassed the performance of other foundational sodium reagents (namely, <em>n</em>-butylsodium and sodium diisopropylamide). However, NaHMDS suffers from its markedly low p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>. We have recently developed a series of previously unexplored monosilyl sodium amides which possess good hydrocarbon solubility, remarkable stability, and <em>reactivity akin to that of lithium diisopropylamide (LDA)</em>.

                <b>Beetle luciferases with naturally red- and blue-shifted emission.</b>
                The mechanism of color tuning in bioluminescence remains one of the longest standing questions in the field. In this mutagenesis study, we examined the luciferases of two far-emitting bioluminescent insects (<em>Phrixothrix hirtus</em> and <em>Amydetes vivianii</em>) characterizing their structures, kinetics, thermostability, and substrate affinities to reveal the effect of their subtle differences on the emission color.

                    Camphorsultam-based lithium enolates referred to colloquially as Oppolzer enolates are examined spectroscopically, crystallographically, kinetically, and computationally to ascertain the mechanism of alkylation and the origin of the stereoselectivity. Solvent- and substrate-dependent structures include tetramers for alkylsubstituted enolates in toluene, unsymmetric dimers for aryl-substituted enolates in toluene, substrate-independent symmetric dimers in THF and THF/toluene mixtures, HMPA-bridged trisolvated dimers at low HMPA concentrations, and disolvated monomers for the aryl-substituted enolates at elevated HMPA concentrations. Extensive analyses of the stereochemistry of aggregation are included. Rate studies for reaction with allyl bromide implicate an HMPA-solvated ion pair with a <sup>+</sup>Li(HMPA)<sub>4</sub> counterion. Dependencies on toluene and THF are attributed to exclusively secondary shell (medium) effects. Aided by density functional theory (DFT) computations, a stereochemical model is presented in which neither chelates nor the lithium gegenion serve roles. The stereoselectivity stems from the chirality within the sultam ring and not the camphor skeletal core.

                    The preparation, structure, physical properties, and reactivities of sodium isopropyl(trimethylsilyl)amide (NaPTA) are described. Solubilities at room temperature range from <em>n</em>-heptane (0.55 M), <em>n</em>-hexane (0.60 M), toluene (0.65 M), MTBE (1.7 M), Et<sub>3</sub>N (3.2 M), and THF (>6.0 M). The half-life to destruction in neat THF is >1 year at 25 °C and 7 days at 70 °C, which compares favorably to 2.5 months and 1.5 days, respectively, for LDA in neat THF. The manuscript focuses on NaPTA/THF solutions. <sup>29</sup>Si spectroscopy shows exclusively a mixture of <em>cis</em> and <em>trans</em> stereoisomeric dimers in 0.10–12 M THF in hexane. Density functional theory (DFT) computations suggest a p<em>K</em><sub>b</sub> that is intermediate between dimeric sodium  diisopropylamide (NaDA) and dimeric sodium hexamethyldisilazide (NaHMDS). Metalations of arenes, epoxides, ketones, hydrazones, alkenes, and alkyl halides show higher reactivities than LDA (<em>k</em><sub>NaPTA/LDA</sub> = 1–30). While the rates of arene metalation are high, the lower p<em>K</em><sub>b</sub> of NaPTA limits the substrates. Metalation of pseudoephedrate-based carboxamides to form disodiated Myers enolates solves several challenging technical problems.

                    The chemical reactions underlying the emission of light in fireflies and other bioluminescent beetles are some of the most thoroughly studied processes by scientists worldwide. Despite these remarkable efforts, fierce academic arguments continue around even some of the most fundamental aspects of the reaction mechanism behind the beetle bioluminescence. In an attempt to reach a consensus, we made an exhaustive search of the available literature and compiled the key discoveries on the fluorescence and chemiluminescence spectrochemistry of the emitting molecule, the firefly oxyluciferin, and its chemical analogues reported over the past 50+ years. The factors that affect the light emission, including intermolecular interactions, solvent polarity, and electronic effects, were analyzed in the context of both the reaction mechanism and the different colors of light emitted by different luciferases. The collective data points toward a combined emission of multiple coexistent forms of oxyluciferin as the most probable explanation for the variation in color of the emitted light. We also highlight realistic research directions to eventually address some of the remaining questions related to firefly bioluminescence. It is our hope that this extensive compilation of data and detailed analysis will not only consolidate the existing body of knowledge on this important phenomenon but will also aid in reaching a wider consensus on some of the mechanistic details of firefly bioluminescence.

                    In beetles, luciferase enzymes catalyse the conversion of chemical energy into light through bioluminescence. The principles of this process have become a fundamental biotechnological tool that revolutionized biological research. Different beetle species can emit different colours of light, despite using the same substrate and highly homologous luciferases. The chemical reasons for these different colours are hotly debated yet remain unresolved. This Review summarizes the structural, biochemical and spectrochemical data on beetle bioluminescence reported over the past three decades. We identify the factors that govern what colour is emitted by wild-type and mutant luciferases. This topic is controversial, but, in general, we note that green emission requires cationic residues in a specific position near the benzothiazole fragment of the emitting molecule, oxyluciferin. The commonly emitted green–yellow light can be readily changed to red by introducing a variety of individual and multiple mutations. However, complete switching of the emitted light from red to green has not been accomplished and the synergistic effects of combined mutations remain unexplored. The minor colour shifts produced by most known mutations could be important in establishing a ‘mutational catalogue’ to fine-tune emission of beetle luciferases, thereby expanding the scope of their applications.

                    Chemiluminescence, a process of transduction of energy stored within chemical bonds of ground-state reactants into light via high-energy excited intermediates, is known in solution, but has remained undetected in macroscopic crystalline solids. By detecting thermally induced chemiluminescence from centimeter-size crystals of an organic peroxide here we demonstrate direct transduction of heat into light by thermochemiluminescence of bulk crystals. Heating of crystals of lophine hydroperoxide to ~115°C results in detectable emission of blue-green light with maximum at 530 nm with low chemiluminescent quantum yield [(2.1±0.1) × 10<sup>‒7</sup>E mol<sup>‒1</sup>]. Spectral comparison of the thermochemiluminescence in the solid state and in solution revealed that the solid-state thermochemiluminescence of lophine peroxide is due to emission from deprotonated lophine. With selected 1,2-dioxetane, endoperoxide and aroyl peroxide we also establish that the thermochemiluminescence is common for crystalline peroxides, with the color of the emitted light varying from blue to green to red.

                    The yellow-green light emitted by fireflies is one of the most prominent examples of bioluminescence. Firefly oxyluciferin, the emitting molecule, is labile in alkaline solutions, and its structure is strongly affected by solvent polarity and pH. Previous studies have suggested that variations in the active site conditions are likely contributors to the color of bioluminescent emission. Herein, we incorporate firefly oxyluciferin into an agarose matrix to emulate the enzyme active site. Self-supporting, lightweight thin films were fabricated by solution casting and spectroscopically characterized. The previously described acidochromism of oxyluciferin is conserved in the thin films. The bathochromic shift observed in alkaline conditions results from the formation of the oxyluciferin dianion. This study demonstrates an alternative approach to investigating environmental effects on bioluminescent molecules.

                    The different colors of light emitted by bioluminescent beetles that use an identical substrate and chemiexcitation reaction sequence to generate light remain a challenging and controversial mechanistic conundrum. The crystal structures of two beetle luciferases with red- and blue-shifted light relative to the green yellow light of the common firefly species provide direct insight into the molecular origin of the bioluminescence color. The structure of a blue-shifted green-emitting luciferase from the firefly Amydetes vivianii is monomeric with a structural fold similar to the previously reported firefly luciferases. The only known naturally red-emitting luciferase from the glow-worm Phrixothrix hirtus exists as tetramers and octamers. Structural and computational analyses reveal varying aperture between the two domains enclosing the active site. Mutagenesis analysis identified two conserved loops that contribute to the color of the emitted light. These results are expected to advance comparative computational studies into the conformational landscape of the luciferase reaction sequence.
