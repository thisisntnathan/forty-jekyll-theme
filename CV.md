### The Collum Group

Graduate Research Assistant | 2018 - present  
**Structural studies of enolates of the N-acyl Oppolzer sultams.**  

### The Rabeh Lab

Undergraduate Researcher | 2016 - 2018  
**Beetle luciferases with naturally red- and blue-shifted emission.**  
The mechanism of color tuning in bioluminescence remains one of the longest standing questions in the field. In this mutagenesis study, we examine the luciferases of two far-emitting bioluminescent insects (*Phrixothrix hirtus* and *Amydetes vivianii*) characterizing their structures, kinetics, thermostability, and substrate affinities to reveal the effect of their subtle differences on the emission colour.

### Naumov Materals Research Group

Undergraduate Researcher | 2016 - 2018  
**Thermochemiluminescent Peroxide Crystals.**  
Chemiluminescence is a process of energy transduction which transforms chemical energy into light that is commonly reported in solution. We studied an occurance of thermally induced chemiluminescence in a macroscopic crystal of lophine hydroperoxide, developing various low-light and variable-temperature analytical methods, elucidating the mechanism of hydroperoxide decomposition, and demonstrating the first instance of thermochemiluminescence in the solid state.

**pH-Dependent fluorescence from firefly oxyluciferin in agarose thin films.**  
Utilizing oxyluciferin, the product of firefly bioluminescence, we fabricated and spectroscopically characterized an agarose-based thin film for use as a humidity sensor. Absorbance and fluorescence studies found that the pH- and humidity-responsive solution-state photochemistry of oxyluciferin is conserved in the solid-state demonstrating an alternative approach to the investigation of environmental effects on bioluminescent systems.


### The Rivera Lab for Supramolecular Chemistry

NSF-REU Program | Summer 2017  
**Hierarchical assembly of supramolecular G-quadruplexes via enzyme instructed self-assembly.** 
Building off the Rivera group’s previous work with guanosine derived supramolecular complexes, we synthesized phosphorylated guanosine derivatives which form host-like microglobluar assemblies at high temperatures.  We showed that dephosphorylation by a common alkaline phosphatase induces formation of the supramolecular assemblies.  The project provided proof of concept for the enzyme-instructed formation of nonpolymeric supramolecular assemblies and laid the groundwork for creating artificial organelles *in vivo*.
